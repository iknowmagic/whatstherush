# What’s The Rush?

**An advocacy project for a slower, more humane future**

---

**What’s The Rush?** is a cultural critique disguised as a digital campaign. It challenges the myth that faster is always better — especially in the age of AI and automation.

At its core, this project asks:

> The planet has been here for billions of years.  
> **What’s the f\*cking rush?**

## Why this matters

Technology was supposed to free us from endless work.  
Instead, it’s accelerated everything — including burnout.

Despite promises of productivity, many workers feel more pressure, longer hours, and less control. AI that was meant to offload tasks is now driving the same exploitative systems — only faster.

We were told we’d have more time.  
Instead, we’re drowning in notifications, meetings, and digital overload.

This project says: **enough.**

## What we believe

- **Technology should serve life — not accelerate it**
- **Ethics over hype**
- **Sustainability over growth**
- **Time over metrics**
- **Presence over productivity**

We advocate for humane tech, slow design, and a new definition of productivity: one measured in **wellbeing**, not output.

---

## What we’re fighting

- Accelerationism as default
- The broken promise of AI-enabled leisure
- Work cultures that glorify exhaustion
- Metrics that value speed over substance

---

## What we’re proposing

- A slower pace — in design, in work, in life
- Tools that restore autonomy, not extract attention
- A shift in values: from hustle to depth, from scale to meaning

This isn’t nostalgia.  
It’s a call for **deliberate progress.**

Technology is not the enemy.  
**The rush is.**
